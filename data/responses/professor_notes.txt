**Definition**: A function $y(t)$ is said to approach zero as $t \rightarrow \infty$ if for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a large enough $T > 0$ such that $|y(t)| < \epsilon$ for all $t \geq T$.

**Proof of (a)**: 

Let's assume that $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ are two linearly independent solutions of the given differential equation. Using the standard technique, we can write the general solution of the differential equation as:
$$y(t) = c_1 y_1(t) + c_2 y_2(t)$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants determined by the initial conditions. Now, let's assume that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all positive.

We can consider two cases:

Case 1: Both $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ have real roots.

In this case, we know that $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ can be written as:
$$y_1(t) = A_1 e^{r_1 t} \quad \text{and} \quad
y_2(t) = A_2 e^{r_2 t}$$

where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the two real roots of the characteristic equation $ar^2 + br + c = 0$, and $A_1$ and $A_2$ are constants determined by the initial conditions. We know that since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive, $r_1$ and $r_2$ must be negative. Therefore, as $t$ approaches infinity, $e^{r_1 t}$ and $e^{r_2 t}$ both approach zero. Hence, $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ both approach zero, and so does their linear combination $y(t)$.

Case 2: Both $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ have complex roots.

In this case, we know that $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ can be written as:
$$y_1(t) = e^{(a + ib)t} \quad \text{and} \quad
y_2(t) = e^{(a - ib)t}$$

where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Again, $a$ must be negative since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive. Therefore, as $t$ approaches infinity, $e^{at}$ approaches zero. Moreover, since $b$ is nonzero, $|y_1(t)|$ and $|y_2(t)|$ both oscillate but are bounded as $t$ approaches infinity, which means that their linear combination $y(t)$ is also bounded. Hence, $y(t)$ approaches zero as $t$ approaches infinity.

**Proof of (b)**: 

Let's assume that $y(t)$ is a solution of the given differential equation and both $a$ and $c$ are positive but $b$ is zero. Using the standard technique, we can write the general solution of the differential equation as:
$$y(t) = c_1 y_1(t) + c_2 y_2(t)$$

where $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ are two linearly independent solutions of the differential equation. We only need to show that all solutions of the form $y_1(t) = e^{r_1 t}$ and $y_2(t) = e^{r_2 t}$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the two real roots of the characteristic equation $ar^2 + br + c = 0$, are bounded as $t$ approaches infinity.

We can write $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ as:
$$y_1(t) = A_1 e^{\sqrt{\frac{ac}{a}} t} \quad \text{and} \quad
y_2(t) = A_2 e^{-\sqrt{\frac{ac}{a}} t}$$

where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are constants determined by the initial conditions. Since $a$ and $c$ are positive, we know that $\sqrt{\frac{ac}{a}}$ is positive. Therefore, as $t$ approaches infinity, $y_1(t)$ approaches infinity and $y_2(t)$ approaches zero. Hence, the linear combination $y(t) = c_1 y_1(t) + c_2 y_2(t)$ is bounded as $t$ approaches infinity.

**Proof of (c)**: 

Let's assume that $y(t)$ is a solution of the given differential equation and $a$ and $b$ are positive but $c$ is zero. Using the standard technique, we can write the general solution of the differential equation as:
$$y(t) = c_1 y_1(t) + c_2 y_2(t)$$

where $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ are two linearly independent solutions of the differential equation. We need to determine the value of $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $y(0) = y_0$ and $y'(0) = y_0'$.

We know that $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ can be written as:
$$y_1(t) = A_1 e^{\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}t} \quad \text{and} \quad
y_2(t) = A_2 e^{\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}t}$$

where $A_1$, $A_2$ are constants determined by the initial conditions, and $\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ are the two roots of the characteristic equation $ar^2 + br + c = 0$. Since $c$ is zero, one of the roots is zero and the other is $-\frac{b}{a}$. Therefore, we can write $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ as:
$$y_1(t) = A_1 e^{\frac{-b}{2a}t} \quad \text{and} \quad
y_2(t) = A_2$$

Now, we can determine the value of $c_1$ and $c_2$ by solving the system of equations:
$$c_1 y_1(0) + c_2 y_2(0) = y(0)$$
$$c_1 y_1'(0) + c_2 y_2'(0) = y'(0)$$

which gives us:

$$c_1 = y_0$$
$$c_2 = \frac{y_0'}{\frac{-b}{a}} - y_0$$

Therefore, the solution of the differential equation can be written as:

$$y(t) = y_0 + \left[\frac{y_0'}{\frac{-b}{a}} - y_0\right]e^{\frac{-b}{a}t}$$

As $t$ approaches infinity, the second term in the equation approaches zero and the solution approaches $y_0 + \frac{y_0'}{\frac{-b}{a}} = y_0 - \frac{ay_0'}{b}$. Therefore, the constant that the solution approaches as $t$ approaches infinity is $y_0 - \frac{ay_0'}{b}$.
