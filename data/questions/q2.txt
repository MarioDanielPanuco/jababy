Consider the second order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients:
ay′′ +by′ +cy = 0 (1)
Prove that:
• If a, b, c are positive, all solutions of equation (1) approach zero as t → ∞.
• Ifa>0,c>0butb=0,allsolutionsofequation(1)areboundedast→∞.
• If a > 0, b > 0 but c = 0, all solutions of equation (1) approach a constant that depends on the initial conditions as t → ∞. Determine this constant for the initial conditions y(0) = y0, y′(0) = y0′ .
